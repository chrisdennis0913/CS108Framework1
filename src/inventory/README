Inventory README

Decided to use the factory design pattern to allow the Items to practically create themselves.
Use the MakeItems class if you need Items made. ;)

Look at Start, line 70 for an example of how to create an item properly.

It currently looks like
        ItemSub sword =
            MI.parseExpression("Golden Sword of Paradise, sword, Weapon, true, 100, 55");
        int[] loc =
            new int[] {
                    game.getBG().getWidth() / 2 - 10,
                    game.getBG().getHeight() / 4 * 3 };
        sword.add(loc, 0);
        items.put("sword", sword);

where MI is a MakeItems object instantiated in the Level super class.
